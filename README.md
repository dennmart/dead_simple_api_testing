# Dead-Simple API Tests With SuperTest, Mocha, and Chai

This repository is a demonstration on building fast and maintainable API tests using [SuperTest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest), [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), and [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/). The examples in this repo are explained in detail in the [Dev Tester blog](https://dev-tester.com/).

To run the tests, you first need an account at [Airport Gap](https://airportgap.dev-tester.com/), an application built to help you improve your test automation skills. After signing up, you'll receive an API token to access the endpoints requiring authentication.

## Running the tests

- Run `npm install` to set up all dependencies.
- Set up your Airport Gap API token as an environment variable called `AIRPORT_GAP_TOKEN`.
- Execute the test suite with `npm test`.
